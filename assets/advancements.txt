{{Q|The system as a whole is called "advancements", which is aimed at guiding & tracking player's progress through the game (in vanilla [[survival]] and any custom additions by mapmakers or [[mods]]). Most advancements are literally just that - an advancement through the game.|[[Dinnerbone]]|the advancements system<ref>{{reddit|64pk6r/dinnerbone_working_on_giving_advancements|dg4uiou}}</ref>|Dinnerbone-twitter.png}}
{{TOC|right}}
[[File:AdvancementMade.png|thumb|right|240px|The popup that appears when an advancement is completed.]]
[[File:GoalReached.png|thumb|right|240px|The popup that appears when a goal advancement is completed.]]
[[File:ChallengeComplete.png|thumb|right|240px|The popup that appears when special challenge advancements are completed.]]

'''Advancements''' are a way to gradually guide new players into ''Minecraft'' and give them challenges to complete, similar to the more simple system of [[achievements]] in the [[Legacy Console Edition]], [[Bedrock edition]]s, and ''[[New Nintendo 3DS Edition]]''.

== Obtaining ==

Advancements can be completed in any [[game mode]], and are obtained and saved per world. Advancements can also be granted (and revoked) using the {{cmd|advancement}} command.

Although advancements guide players logically through the game, they are independent of each other; an advancement can be completed without having completed the advancements "before" it.

When an advancement is obtained, a sliding toast notification displays in the top right corner and a message will be displayed in chat. The color of the header text in the notification depends on the advancement; normal and goal advancements have yellow header text, while challenge advancements have pink header text. Completing a normal advancement will make the header text display "Advancement Made!", completing a goal advancement will result in a "Goal Reached!" header and a challenge advancement will give "Challenge Complete!".

== Interface ==

[[File:AdvancementsInterface.png|thumb|300px|The advancements interface. One advancement ("Isn't It Iron Pick") is selected.]]

The button to access the Advancements screen is found on the pause menu screen. You can also open this screen by pressing {{key|L}} (this can be changed in the in-game [[options]] menu).

The advancement system involves several trees composed of advancements, each tree beginning with a root advancement and ending with goal or challenge advancements. By clicking and dragging, you can view different branches of an advancement tree. Each tree is categorized into different tabs (which are, themselves, advancements). There are currently five tabs in vanilla Minecraft (although [[#Tab_creation|more may be added]]<ref name="4/5InVanilla>{{tweet|dinnerbone|845191916689928192|The tabs are alternate trees that are themselves advancements too. We support a lot, but we'll use 4/5 in vanilla. http://media.dinnerbone.com/uploads/2017-03/screenshots/24_09-23-41_rYLfqg0Q52.png|March 24, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{tweet|dinnerbone|846378379746136064|4 or 5 tabs. Probably: "mine & craft", "nether", "end", "combat", "engineering" or some variant of.|March 27, 2017}}</ref>):

* [[#Minecraft|'''Minecraft''']]: The heart and story of the game.
* [[#Adventure|'''Adventure''']]: Adventure, exploration, and combat.
* [[#Nether|'''Nether''']]: Bring summer clothes.
* [[#The End|'''The End''']]: Or the beginning?
* [[#Husbandry|'''Husbandry''']]: The world is full of friends and food.

Each tab has a different background with a repeating texture.

Advancement icons display a header name and description when hovered over. The advancement descriptions are a separate color than the icons themselves, with normal and goal advancements having green descriptions and challenge advancements having purple ones. They only appear in a tree when the advancement before it is completed, although, as stated before, advancements can be completed in any order. Up to 2 advancements are displayed ahead of a completed one.

If the player has not completed any advancements, the interface will show a black background with white text reading "There doesn't seem to be anything here... :(".

The icon frames of advancements can vary in appearance based on difficulty, and whether or not it was completed. A legend is provided below:

{| class="wikitable" data-description="Advancement icons" style="text-align: center"
! colspan="2" | Icon Frame
! rowspan="2" | Description

Extra advancements and tabs can be added and customized with the use of JSON files, [[#JSON Format|as detailed below]].

== JSON Format ==

Custom advancements in [[data pack]]s of a ''Minecraft'' world store the advancement data for that world as separate JSON files.

All advancement JSON files are structured according to the following format:

<div class="treeview">
* {{nbt|compound}} The root tag.
** {{nbt|compound|display}}: The optional display data.
*** {{nbt|compound|icon}}: The data for the icon.
**** {{nbt|string|item}}: The item id.
**** {{nbt|string|nbt}}: The nbt data of the item.
*** {{nbt|string|title}}: The title for this advancement.
*** {{nbt|compound|title}}: A JSON text component (containing text and formatting like used in /tellraw and various other commands. Also translate tag can be used here).
*** {{nbt|string|frame}}: The optional type of frame for the icon. <code>challenge</code> for a tile with a more fancy spiked border as it is used for the kill all mobs advancement, <code>goal</code> for a tile with a rounded border as it is used for the full beacon advancement, <code>task</code> for a normal tile (default.)
*** {{nbt|string|background}}: The optional directory for the background to use in this advancement tab (only used for the root advancement).
*** {{nbt|string|description}}: The description of the advancement.
*** {{nbt|compound|description}}: A [[Command#Raw JSON Text|JSON text component]] (containing text and formatting like used in {{cmd|tellraw}} and various other commands. Also translate tag can be used here).
*** {{nbt|boolean|show_toast}}: Can be <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. Whether or not to show the toast pop up after completing this advancement. Defaults to true.
*** {{nbt|boolean|announce_to_chat}}: Can be <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. Whether or not to announce in the chat when this advancement has been completed. Defaults to true.
*** {{nbt|boolean|hidden}}: Can be <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. Whether or not to hide this advancement and all its children from the advancement screen until this advancement have been completed. Has no effect on root advancements themselves, but will still affect all their children. Defaults to false.
** {{nbt|string|parent}}: The optional parent advancement directory of this advancement. If this field is absent, this advancement is a root advancement. Circular reference will cause a loading failure.
** {{nbt|compound|criteria}}: The required criteria that have to be met.
*** {{nbt|compound|<criterionName>}}: A name given to the criterion (can be any string, must be unique).
**** {{nbt|string|trigger}}: The [[#List of triggers|trigger]] for this advancement; specifies what the game should check for the advancement.
**** {{nbt|compound|conditions}}: All the [[#List of triggers|conditions]] that need to be met when the trigger gets activated.
** {{nbt|list|requirements}}: An optional list of requirements (all the <nowiki><criteriaNames></nowiki>). If all criteria are required, this may be omitted. With multiple criteria: requirements contains a list of lists with criteria (all criteria need to be mentioned). If all of the lists each have any criteria met, it will complete the advancement. (basically AND grouping of OR groups)
** {{nbt|compound|rewards}}: An optional object representing the rewards provided when this advancement is obtained.
*** {{nbt|list|recipes}}: A list of [[recipe]]s to unlock.
**** {{nbt|string}} A [[namespaced ID]] for a recipe.
*** {{nbt|list|loot}}: A list of [[loot table]]s to give to the player.
**** {{nbt|string}} A [[namespaced ID]] for a loot table.
*** {{nbt|int|experience}}: An amount of [[experience]].
*** {{nbt|string|function}}: A [[Function (Java Edition)|function]] to run. [[Tag#Function_Tags|Function tags]] are not allowed.
</div>

=== Display ===
Within the root tag of an advancement JSON object, the {{nbt|compound|display}} field and the {{nbt|string|parent}} field, both optional, are related to the display of the advancement.

If the {{nbt|compound|display}} tag is present, it must have both the {{nbt|string}}{{nbt|compound|title}} and {{nbt|string}}{{nbt|compound|description}} fields present in order to be a valid advancement display data.

The {{nbt|string|parent}} field, albeit not directly associated with the display data of an advancement, only affects the display data effectively. When an advancement does not have a display data and none of its children has a display data, the parent of the advancement has no effect to the advancement itself.

To create a tab in the [[#Interface|advancement menu]], define a root advancement (an advancement without a parent) with a display. When the [[data pack]] containing the advancement is loaded, the root advancement will have a tab in the advancement menu when any of the advancements in its advancement tree is granted to the player viewing the menu.

When a background is not specified for a root advancement, the tab will still be created. However, the background of the tab will be the [[missing texture]].

==== Presence ====
For a non-root advancement (i.e. an advancement with a parent defined), these conditions must be met in order to have it displayed in a tab when unlocked:
# Its root advancement must be [[#Tab_creation|a valid tab]].
# It must have a display.

==== Position ====
The game will automatically arrange advancements and position them when it loads advancements from data packs and send the arrangement to the client. Each advancement will have an arrow from its closest visible ancestor (i.e. if its parent does not have a display, it will have a link from its grandparent, so on). The root advancement will be on the leftmost column while each arrow will point to an advancement in the next column.

==== Lack of Display ====
Some advancements, such as the vanilla recipe unlocking advancements, may lack a display so that they can utilize [[#List_of_triggers|triggers]] and rewards instead of excessive [[commands]] or [[Function (Java Edition)|functions]] for more functionalities and a more flexible control. These advancements should not have {{nbt|compound|display}} or {{nbt|string|parent}} fields defined in order to hide from users and enjoy a better loading performance.
